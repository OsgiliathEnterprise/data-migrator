Data Migrator tool This tool aims to help the developer or business analyst to gather production data from a source datasource of any vendor, create the same structure in target database (same technology or other vendor or version, thanks to orm) then to execute the data transfer with a data transformation sequence in between: standard anonymization (i.e. replacing column values with random values or limiting the amount or rows), or custom scripted anonymization, e.g. executing tailor-made java custom business on top of spring data repositories or Tinkerpop's graph queries and even ai-driven. Procedure Configure your machine prerequisites: java 21, docker and maven. Create a new anonymization project for your context from the maven data-migrator maven archetype ( mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=net.osgiliath.datamigrator.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=datamigrator-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=<current version of the archetype> ), ensure to choose a name without special characters (i.e. myanonymizationproject, without '-', '_', ...). Start a container of your using your source database technology (optional if you have access to the remote database). You can tweak the compose.yml file at the root of the generated project. Import your production dump into your local database (optional if you have access to the remote database) Configure the project's database.properties with your databases information. Generate the java entities, java tables metamodel and repositories from the root of your generated project using the ./mvnw clean process-classes -Pentities-from-source-schema command: doing so, new classes will appear on the /target/generated-sources directory. Create your custom business logic (java code) on top of the spring-data-repositories and queries (optional if you use common modules that do ot need any customization). Configure your anonymization sequence using the src/main/resources/application.yml property file with data-migrator sequence and sequencers. Start your target database container (optional if you have access to the remote database). Launch the sequencing: ./mvnw package && cd target && java -jar <yourjar>.jar . Additional useful commands ./mvnw process-classes -Ptarget-data-changelog-target-db a liquibase schema changelog (including data) from target database for manual processing (unfortunately, the target/classes/config/liquibase-sink/changelog will have to be modified manually to remove the absolute path part of the sections, i.e. /config/liquibase-sink/data , and a master.xml file has to be created referencing the changelog file) ./mvnw process-classes -Ptarget-db-from-target-data-changelog -Dliquibase.duplicateFileMode=WARN a liquibase schema changelog (including data) from target database for manual processing ./mvnw clean verify -Pdata-changelog-from-source-db to generate a liquibase changelog from source DATA ./mvnw clean verify -Pentities-from-changelog to generate a source database and entities from a liquibase changelog ./mvnw clean verify -Pschema-changelog-from-source-db to generate a liquibase changelog from source SCHEMA Customization of the anonymization Creating your own custom business logic You can create your own sequencer by extending MetamodelColumnCellTransformer (cell level) or JpaEntityColumnTransformer (entity level) and adding it to the application.yml file. For sequencers that needs some context (they can't be singleton beans), you'll need to create a FactorySequencer Factory bean that will create the sequencer instance. Integration testing for your anonymization sequence In order to try this project, the simplest procedure is to setup a source database, inject the data into it, then generate the entities, and finally run the tests that will inject the data into the target database. the sample-mono project illustrates this procedure (see pom.xml test configuration, as well as the test classes). Standard anonymization Fake data generation Here's how you can configure the fake data generation (will replace all the values of the column with fake data): - name: column-anonymize-1 type: factory transformer-class: net.osgiliath.migrator.modules.faker.ColumnFaker entity-class: com.mypackage.Employee column-transformation-definitions: - column-name: firstName consistent-key: True # will reuse value of a previously faked entry options: - faker: dragon_ball.characters There are a lot of options for the faker, see the faker documentation . Row limiting You can limit the number of rows to be injected in the target database using the row-limit sequencer: - name: rows-minimize-1 type: bean transformer-class: net.osgiliath.migrator.modules.rowlimiter.RowLimiter sequencer-options: rows-to-keep: 3 TIPS & TRICKS Remote Tinkergraph server This data migrator basically transforms the database schema into two graphs (metamodel and model) then reinject the data in the sink. By default, a 4gb inmemory graph is created, which could be limitating. Additionally, you may sometimes want to take a look at the entity graph to better understand the data model. Remote tinkerpop server is supported by changing the src/main/resources/application.yml#data-migrator.graph-datasource.type . Setting that property to 'remote' will then need a graph server to be started upfront (see compose.yml). Generated entities Incorrect java entity generation from source database model Hibernates tools are quite good at reverse engineering entities, but are not perfect. You'll need to fix the entities manually. The most common issues are: (optional) adding the mappedBy (owning side id) annotation on @ManyToMany annotation to ensure reproducibility of the anonymization sequence (i.e. the same data will be generated for the same input data). Not doing so will result in a ' mappedBy' annotation added randomly on one or the other side of the relationship, leading to a different entity graph to process at each run. (optional) add @Basic(fetch = FetchType.LAZY) on blobs and clobs attributes (to avoid heavy memory overload). Remove @Version annotation if it's not an hibernate version column (i.e. it's a business version column) Escape the column names that are reserved words in the target database (e.g. @Column(name = \"\\\"schema\\\"\") in postgresql) To batch some entity processing, you can edit the build.xml and add your own Ant tasks. Clob datatype This framework heavily relies on Hibernate tools for entity retro-engineering. This tool has some weird behavior when It sometimes generate Clob type instead of a standard String: prefer replacing the generated entity's field and methods with the proper @JdbcTypeCode Composites Ids with including foreign key Some databases are using some keys as a primary + foreign key. Unfortunately, Hibernate does not generate a proper Mapping yet. To fix that bad behavior, you have to add a @MapsId(\"name of the field in the composite key\")\" on your Entity relationship. The build.xml containing the hack only contains 5 entries rewritten, If you need more you'll have to add new <replaceregexp entries. Mimicking the behavior of XX2PG Ora2PG and Mssql2PG are popular tools to migrate data. The procedure of these tools is quite simple: It first creates the target db schema without any foreign key constraints. It selects data from the source db and injects into the foreignkey-less target db. Once all tables' content are migrated, the constraints on the target db are set. The same procedure using datamigrator would be the following: Configure database.properties with source & target information, also configure application.yml without any sequence. Generate entity from source schema using ./mvnw package -pentities-from-source-schema-nofk . Execute the data migration with java -jar target/<thejar> Regenerate the entities with foreign keys this time: Generate entity from source schema using ./mvnw clean package -pentities-from-source-schema . Execute the data migration with java -jar target/<thejar> , you can stop it just after the hibernate schema update. Transfer the 'many to many' intermediate table by hand as they won't have been created (due to the first nofk migration). Developing/Contributing to the project Running the test (see sample-mono) The source and target database are started using test-containers when executing the integration tests from the sample-mono project ( ./mvnw clean verify -Pentities-from-changelog ). Starting sample mono locally (within an IDE) Start the services in the docker compose file of sample mono Populate the source database ./mvnw process-classes -Pdata-changelog-from-source-db Releasing Bump the version of sample-mono and report-aggregate modules poms according to parent version Merge to main branch.
